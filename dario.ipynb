    "In the next cells, there will be the code that we used for the simulations. A few counterintuitive choices have been made in order to extract as much performance as possible. The first is the removal of every numpy array. As we were not making any use of the vector operations of numpy but just accessing elements, those arrays were slower than lists. We did not save the energy (and the magnetizations) at every instant but just a running average, and we did not normalize the averages in order not to induce numerical instability (sums are very delicate in this regard, but the energy is an int and python int have no upper limit, so they are safe from this point of view).\n",
    "We also ran the simulation on multiple processes in order to make python use all the cores of the cpu. The speed-up in this case was almost linear with the number of cores used.\n",
    "We also did not run the code on Cpython but on PyPy, a JIT compiler for python. This allowed us to get a speed-up of about 8x."
